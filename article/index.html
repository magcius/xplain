        // bit more about the demos in this article.
        //
        // For starters, as I mention at the end of the article, the code that
        // powers all the demos in this article is at GitHub:
        //
        // https://github.com/magcius/xplain
        //
        // Most of the code that I've written is in the X server itself,
        // which can be found at src/server/server.js
        //
        // The extensive "Inspector" can be found in src/inspector/inspector.js
        //
        // The rest of the demos are clients that connect to that server, and
        // they can be found in src/article-demos/.
        //
        // The main demo "runner" framework is at src/article-demos/demos.js,
        // and the code for all the demos in the article are littered around
        // in that directory.
        //
        // I've tried to document it quite well, but if you have any more questions
        // about the code, about anything in this article, or just want to flame
        // me about Wayland or Mir, feel free to contact me through email.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Last year, I wrote <a href="http://blog.mecheye.net/2012/06/the-linux-graphics-stack/">an article</a>
            describing the free and open-source graphics stack, explaining all of the interconnected pieces: X11,
            graphics drivers, DRM, and DRI, and their roles in getting pixels placed on the screen. In the year since,
            I've answered a lot of really good questions from the Linux community about my post, about X11, and about
            Wayland. I've learned a lot.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_%28software%29">Several</a>
            <a href="https://dvdhrm.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/splitting-drm-and-kms-device-nodes/">new</a>
            <a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2013-October/046618.html">technologies</a>
            have appeared, and I have
            <a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/wayland-devel/2013-November/011879.html">started to take a
            more active role in this myself</a>, as part of our efforts to
            <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/Wayland">port GNOME to Wayland</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I still field plenty of questions from lots of people about this, and a lot of the time, it's
            extremely simple stuff: "What is X?" "How does it interact with my graphics card and mouse/keyboard?"
            "What do apps use X for?" "What is Wayland, and how does it fit into the picture?" "What problems did X
            have that made us want to write new display server technologies?"
        </p>
        <p>
            These sort of questions were what inspired me to write "The Linux Graphics Stack" in the first place, but
            there's really never been a comprehensive, historical writeup of our display server technologies in
            general. So, I chose to spend my free time at Red Hat writing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, compared to some of my colleagues, I'm relatively new to the Linux development scene, with only five
            or so years of experience. I've also arrived late, way after we've added lots of hacks to keep the X Window
            System fresh. Most of my knowledge comes from talking to my more experienced coworkers in person, digging
            through mailing list and newsgroup archives, and IRC discussions with the great sports in
            <span class="code-literal">#xorg-devel</span>. So, there's a good possibility that I'll get something wrong,
            guy-who-worked-at-DEC-in-the-80s-waiting-to-correct-me! I'm genuinely sorry if I misrepresent something.
            If you want to discuss this at all, shoot me an email at
            <a href="mailto:jstpierre@mecheye.net">jstpierre@mecheye.net</a>, and let's try to work something out!
        </p>
        <p>
            I also really don't want to inject my bias into this too much. While I do personally believe Wayland is
            going to become The Linux Display Server Of The Future®, and that is a good thing, I'm not trying to rip X
            apart! My intention here is twofold: I want to explain a lot of the more undocumented or harder-to-grasp
            features built into X11 (the permutations of input grabs, for instance), and I also want to provide an
            accurate, historical context on why a certain feature was added
            (<a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/compositeproto/compositeproto.txt">COMPOSITE</a>,
            for instance), and all the clever hacks we've invented along the way
            (<span class="code-literal">WM_TAKE_FOCUS</span>, for instance). I really want this to be a resource for
            somebody looking to learn. If I've inspired anybody out there to write any code, I've accomplished my goal.

        <h3>But before we begin...</h3>
        <p>
            Since this article contains a lot of interactive demos relying on fairly modern browser technology, let's
            make sure that everything is OK before continuing. I've been testing this on modern versions of Firefox
            Nightly and Chrome Canary. 
        </p>
        <div class="demo-server" data-demo="test"></div>
        <p>
            If you can see the stipple pattern above, that means that your browser is modern enough to see the
            interactive demos.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might have noticed that when you ran your mouse over the stipple, your cursor changed. That's because
            this isn't just any old stipple image, that stipple is actually the background of a full X server session
            running in your browser using HTML5 canvas. All of the interactive demos will use this framework to explain
            what's going on under the hood.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section id="basic-architecture">
        <h3>Basic Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            Although it may sound a bit stilted, notice how I keep saying "the X Window System" instead of the more
            traditional shorthands "X", "X11", or "Xorg"? I want to be very careful to separate the ideas and design of
            the system from its component parts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The X Window System is a networked display system. A server component, the
            <span class="definition">X server</span>, is responsible for coordinating between all of the clients
            connected, taking input from the mouse and keyboard, and pushing pixels on the output. The most popular X
            server implementation is the <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver">Xorg X server</a>,
            developed by the X.Org Foundation and community. There are other X server implementations: you might
            remember that Xorg was forked from <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</a> a decade ago, that Sun
            Microsystems has had several X server implementations, in both
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xsun">Xsun</a> and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xnews_%28X11_server%29">XNeWS</a>. Today, Xorg is the dominant
            X server implementation, getting most of the development. But back in the day, multiple competing
            implementations existed.
        </p>
        <p>
            X servers and X clients all talk a standardized network protocol to each other, known as
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html">X11</a>. This protocol is
            well-specified, from the wire format to the semantics of every request. The protocol documentation linked
            above is invaluable documentation for any hacker who wants to learn more about this stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Applications and toolkits don't write the wire format onto the socket directly, however. They often use
            client libraries that implement the protocols, like the traditional
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/libX11/libX11.html">Xlib</a> library, or the
            somewhat newer <a href="http://xcb.freedesktop.org/">xcb</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm going to try and be precise in my nomenclature in this article.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I talk about features or design decisions of the overall system, I will try to call it
            <span class="definition">the X Window System</span>, even if it sounds a bit verbose. e.g.
            <q><span class="definition">The X Window System</span> provides us Pixmaps, which are images in the
            server's memory.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            When I talk about features or details of the network protocol, I will talk about
            <span class="definition">the X11 protocol</span>. e.g. <q><span class="definition">The X11 protocol</span>
            provides for a generic extension mechanism, which allows for a forward-compatible way to implement new
            features without having to redesign older parts of X11</q>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I talk about the behavior of a client or a server, I'll say <span class="definition">X client</span>
            or <span class="definition">X server</span> e.g. <q>Using the MIT-SHM extension, <span class="definition">X
            clients</span> can pass memory buffers to the <span class="definition">X server</span> using POSIX shared
            memory, which prevents networking and large copies</q>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I talk about features or the architecture in the Xorg X server implementation, I'll mention it
            explicitly as <span class="definition">Xorg</span> or <span class="definition">the Xorg X server</span>,
            e.g. <q>In order to make drawing calls accelerated, <span class="definition">Xorg</span> video drivers can
            provide hardware-accelerated versions of certain drawing primitives through EXA.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            If I ever say "such-and-such is a feature of X", it's a bug.

            The source code to this article and all demos is freely available under the MIT/X11 license on
            <a href="http://github.com/magcius/xplain">GitHub</a> for inspection. I've tried to make the source code
            well-commented, and be a useful resource for learning from as well, so for a third dimension of learning,
            you can inspect my source code for the server and all the demos and figure out how things work that way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the more tricky code in there has been ported from the
            <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver">Xorg X server</a> itself, and the code doing region
            calculations has been compiled from the <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/pixman/">pixman</a> graphics
            library using <a href="http://emscripten.org">emscripten</a>.
            <a href="https://github.com/magcius/pixman">Patches are over this way</a>...

            Some of the images in this article have been adapted from other images on the web. The two kitten images
            in the Expose event demo were adapted from photos taken by
            <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/titrans/">quatre mains</a> and
            <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fazen/">fazen</a>, shared under a

            <a href="http://placekitten.com/attribution.html">[placekitten]</a> for finding these images for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cursors and icons used in the demos have been adapted GNOME's default theme,
            <a href="https://git.gnome.org/browse/adwaita-icon-theme/">Adwaita</a>.
            Some of the icons in the inspector have been adapted from the
