        <h3>Recap</h3>
        <p>
            Last time, we got more intimately familiar with the technical details of the
            <span class="definition">window</span>, one of X11's basic building blocks for building interactive user
            interfaces. We learned that windows can be composed and nested, which allows for complex event delivery
            and simplified code on the part of the toolkit, at the expense of added latency and graphical glitches.
        </p>
        <p>
            It might seem like the vision of the desktop the X11 protocol had in mind doesn't match how users
            actually used it and how user interfaces, as a whole, evolved. One could even say that the window tree
            expected composing user interfaces in a way that doesn't really match reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            I, in perhaps an ill-fated attempt to remain impartial, won't give my opinion on this, specifically,
            but today I want to talk about another feature commonly seen in modern user interface design, and how
            it offers challenges with the drawing model X11 specified and expects clients to use. I am, specifically,
            talking about alpha blending and transparency, or more specifically, "compositing". We'll take a look at
            what the
            <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/compositeproto/tree/compositeproto.txt">X <span class="code-literal">COMPOSITE</span> extension</a>
            does, how it works, and how it can be used together with other technologies to build a modern looking
            graphics system, all while remaining complete backwards compatibility with older systems. It's quite clever!
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't want to remain too harsh on the X Window System. I can't really fault it for the lack of alpha
            blending. The system was first designed at MIT in 1984, the same exact year that Thomas Porter and
            Tom Duff released <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=808606">Compositing Digital Images</a>,
            the seminal paper from which the mathematical underpinnings of alpha blending and alpha compositing
            are taken. Computer graphics was a rapidly-innovating field in that time, so for its day, it did
            quite well.
        </p>

        <section id="window-map">
        <h3>A different direction</h3>
        <p>
            I've long said that windows, in the X11 sense, aren't a tangible thing. They simply make their mark on
            the X server's front buffer, as a series of pixels which they own. The X server keeps track of which pixels
            each window owns, and sends them <span class="code-literal">Expose</span> events to let them know when
            to paint to these pixels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another way to think about this is that every pixel inside the server is owned by exactly one window.
            At any given point in time, you can point to a pixel, and the server can tell you which window is
            responsible for painting it. We can even visualize this. Given the simple moving kittens from the first
            article, we can just give every window a color, and with that, visualize who is responsible for each
            pixel.
        </p>
        <div class="demo-server" data-demo="window-pixel-map"></div>
        <p>
            Here, the blue color represents the root window, the yellow as the top kitten, and the red the bottom
            kitten.
        </p>
        <div class="demo-server" data-demo="window-pixel-map-shaped"></div>
        <p>
            Even when we're shaping the window, we still have the restriction that a pixel is owned by one window.
            The issue with this approach is that there's no way to blend multiple windows together, or letting one
            window be transparent atop one another. This isn't because it's expensive:
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing#Alpha_blending">blending is a simple enough operation</a>.
            The issue is that when the bottommost kitten is being clipped away, we don't have access to its pixels
            at all; they simply don't exist anymore. The topmost kitten window owns that pixel.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the early 90s, transparent terminals dominated Linux desktops with cool Linux graphics. But their
            mechanism was a simple optical illusion: when they drew, they picked up the system's wallpaper, and
            blended their terminal contents against that, leading to
            <a href="http://askubuntu.com/a/266539">punch-through effects</a>. Some more clever programmers found
            other interesting tricks to allow them to gain actual transparency. I won't detail these hacks in depth,
            because it is <span id="current-year">2014</span>, not 1996.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, the first step to getting working compositing would be to have <em>some</em> way of keeping the
            pixels that a window has drawn. This is where the X <span class="code-literal">COMPOSITE</span>
            extension first comes into play.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section id="redirection">
        <h3>Redirection</h3>
        <p>
            It turns out the solution here is astonishingly simple. If we'd prefer that all drawing a window does
            instead goes to some place in memory, we simply create some place in memory and <em>redirect</em> all
            drawing the window to point there instead. And indeed, with the
            <span class="code-literal">RedirectWindow</span> request, we can do exactly that: mark a window so that all
            its drawing operations are indeed <em>redirected</em> so they instead go to some place in memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            But it gets more interesting. As I mentioned way back in the first article, we already have a standard to
            create and represent "images" inside the X server: Pixmaps. I also mentioned that there was this concept
            called <span class="code-literal">Drawable</span> attached to all the drawing operations, which represented
            either a Window, or a Pixmap. So this makes our redirection operation quite simple: if the window is
            redirected, then simply swap out the Drawable the user is drawing to with a secret Pixmap that we created
            which contains the window's contents. For clarity purposes, this secret Pixmap we created is called the
            window's <span class="definition">backing pixmap</span>, since it backs the pixels of the window.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point, you might have another epiphany to bring it all together. I've been using the term "front
            buffer" when talking about where windows draw to. "Yes, yes, it's the place where windows borrow their
            pixels from, and where nothing lasts for ever. We get it already" I hear you cry. But the front buffer also
            has to exist somewhere in the server's memory. So when we're drawing to the front buffer, we're also
            drawing to some image somewhere in the server as well. It turns out that the front buffer has another name:
            the "root pixmap". I'll let that sink in.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a sense, we can also say that any window with a backing pixmap is redirected, and that the root window
            is redirected by default to draw to its backing store, the "root pixmap", which is also the front buffer.
            Relatedly, the child windows of a redirected window actually "borrow pixels" from their backing pixmap in
            the same way windows normally "borrow pixels" from the front buffer. So, instead of saying that
            unredirected windows draw to the root pixmap, we <em>should</em> be saying that unredirected windows draw
            to the same pixmap as their parents. That is, to the pixmap of one of their ancestors which is redirected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Phew. OK, enough talk. Let's take the kitten demo from the first article and redirect the window on the top
            to see what redirecting does.
        </p>
        <div class="demo-server" data-demo="naive-redirect"></div>
        <p>
            ... where did the kitten go? It was redirected to a Pixmap, of course, but we can't actually see it.  You
            see, while the root pixmap is just like any other pixmap, it turns out that it also has a special feature:
            it's also the front buffer. That is, it's also the buffer that we show to you on your monitor.  All other
            pixmaps are off-screen storage. You can't see them unless you draw them to the front buffer.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the way, I didn't cheat or anything and never create the window for the kitten or never map it or
            something like that. This is just how redirection behaves. If you click in the vicinity of where the kitten
            was in the original demo, you can even drag the kitten around. Redirection doesn't affect input... but
            we'll talk more about that later.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section id="all-together">
        <h3>Drawing it all together</h3>
        <p>
            So, now that we have the window redirected and rendering to its own pixmap, now what? How do we turn that
            into transparency? Well, the answer is as simple as it sounds: something else is what takes all those
            windows and paints them together. You see, the way the X Window System was designed has been based on a
            principle of "mechanism, not policy". The X Window System gives application and desktop authors a giant
            toolbox with lots of cool tools to build fun systems, but never tries to dictate how that system could
            work. As such, rendering of all the composited windows is left up to a third-party client called a
            "compositing manager".
        </p>
        <p>
            The compositing manager has one job to do: draw the backing pixmaps of the windows together to form a
            pretty picture as your output. Technically, the compositing manager could not draw any windows, or draw
            some windows more than once, or wobble them around or spin them on a cube, but unfortunately, there's no
            way for the compositing manager to influence how input is sent to individual windows, meaning that the
            compositing manager has no choice but to draw the windows so that they appear in the same place X thinks
            they are, otherwise you might find that you can drag invisible windows around, or clicking on a button is
            offset by a few pixels. Some of the more popular compositing managers might implement effects like wobbly
            windows, but input isn't actually morphed in that case. The effect simply snaps back fast enough before you
            have the chance to click on anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
            But before we go any further, let's talk about the steps a compositing manager would take to put the
            windows on the screen. Now that we've redirected the windows, we can use the
            <span class="code-literal">NameWindowPixmap</span> request to fetch the window's backing pixmap. This
            Pixmap acts just like any other Pixmap on the system, so we can continue to use the standard drawing
            requests we learned about in the first article, like
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html#requests:CopyArea" class="code-literal">CopyArea</a>.
            Unfortunately, this won't do if we want to do true alpha blending,
            since <span class="code-literal">CopyArea</span> and the rest of the core drawing requests were,
            again, invented before the widespread availability and understanding of alpha compositing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to get a graphics API that supports alpha blending, we could opt to use OpenGL or fall back to
            software rendering, perhaps with some
            <a href="http://git.enlightenment.org/apps/eterm.git/tree/src/mmx_cmod.S">state-of-the-art hand-written MMX
            code</a>, both of which are valid options, but thankfully another X11 extension can come to our rescue.
            The <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/renderproto/tree/renderproto.txt">X RENDER extension</a>,
            which supports a variety of advanced vector graphics including matrix transforms and gradients, provides
            to us a <span class="code-literal">Composite</span> operation that can do the job for us. And together
            with that, we can finally draw our windows semi-transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since we've redirected all windows on the desktop away to be able to blend them, the root window, and
            correspondingly, the root pixmap, are actually entirely blank. We can take this opportunity to just claim
            the root window as our own. So, when we paint our beautiful final image, we can actually just paint it
            directly to the root window and it will immediately be visible on the display.
        </p>
        <div class="demo-server" data-demo="composited-kitten"></div>
        <p>
            And after all that work, we finally have transparency.
